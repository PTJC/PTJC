In light of the exciting news from BICEP2 and the forthcoming results from Planck, this quarter our topic will be inflation. The talk schedule is based loosely on Daniel Baumann's 2009 TASI lectures on inflation with the idea that talks 1 and 2 cover his first lecture, talk 3 covers his second lecture, talk 4 covers his third lecture, talk 6 covers his fourth lecture, and talk 5 covers his fifth lecture. Other good references (like Weinberg's Cosmology) are listed on p. 127 of his review and will probably be showing up on the arXiv in the coming weeks!


Intro Cosmology, 4/4
Speaker - Stefan Janiszewski
Abstract - I will kick off our quarter on cosmic Inflation with an introduction to modern cosmology. After giving a taste of general relativity we will examine solutions that describe expected universes. We will then look at the cosmological data to see which of these solutions describes our universe. Lastly, we will examine some puzzling shortcomings to the model.
Notes - Lecture notes here. Powerpoint on cosmological data here.

Single Field Slow Roll Inflation, 4/11
Speaker - Derek Horkel
Abstract - During this talk I will recap the Big Bang Puzzles before introducing inflation and explaining how it can solve the puzzles. I'll then go on to describe slow roll inflation classically (not discussing quantum fluctuations) and a brief discussion of extensions and modifications to slow roll inflation.

Quantum Fluctuations, 4/18
Speaker - Michael Wagman
Abstract - I'll start by explaining how quantum fluctuations in matter and gravity during inflation lead to calculable and measurable
anisotropies in the CMB power spectrum. I'll then derive the power spectrum of tensor and scalar fluctuations during inflation by reducing the calculation to a 1d SHO calculation. I'll end by showing that measurements of the tensor and scalar power spectra tell us the energy scale of inflation.

CMB review, 4/25
Speaker - Akshay Ghalsasi
Abstract - I will begin by "deriving" the Boltzmann Einstein equations that relate the transport of matter, radiation and metric inhomogenities to each other. Then I will evolve these inhomogenities until recombination. Then I will relate those inhomogenities to the anisotropy spectrum today.

Axion Monodromy, 5/2
Speaker - Sudip Paul
Abstract - r ~ 0.1 generically leads to large field inflation. In that case the question of UV completion of the theory assumes significance. Axion monodromy is one way to achieve large scale inflation in the context of string theory. I talked about various constraints that need to be imposed during model building under this scenario. I also talked about one particular model highlighting how it satisfies these constraints.

Non-Gaussianity, 5/9
Speaker - Dorota Grabowska
Abstract - I begin with a quick review of inflation and the derivation of the power spectrum for scalar perturbations. I then introduce the key features of non-Gaussianity, including a short discussion of "in-in" formalism. I give several examples of inflationary models and their characteristic bispectrum shapes. Lastly, I present some experimental results for non-Gaussianity studies.

Gravitational Waves and BICEP2, 5/23
Speaker - Mackenzie Barton-Rowledge
Abstract - Gravitational Waves, Polarization, and (briefly) the BICEP II results: I will emphasize a clear conceptual understanding of how polarization is generated in the CMB from gravity waves.

Reheating, 5/30
Speaker - Brandon Robinson
Abstract - In this lecture we will cover the basics of the current paradigm for generating standard model particles after the end of slow roll inflation. We will consider a simple model of a quadratic inflaton potential wherein we can easily study the perturbative decay of the inflaton field into standard model particles (reheating). Desiring a more explosive growth in the population of standard model particles, we will turn to a more thorough treatment of a non-perturbative mechanism (preheating) to accomplish this.

Chaotic Inflation, 6/6
Speaker - Bridget Bertoni
Abstract - Chaotic Inflation describes a large class of inflation models that arise from chaotic initial conditions. In order to appreciate the ideas behind chaotic inflation I will introduce early inflation models as well as chaotic inflation and discuss how they independently solve the cosmological problems. I will end with observations vs. predictions of inflation with a monomial potential (a stereotypical example of a chaotic inflation potential).

Problems with Inflation, 6/13
Speaker - Seyda Ipek
Abstract - I will talk about 2+1 one problems with inflation: 1) Eternal Inflation: Any inflation scenario (new, chaotic, etc) gives rise to eternal inflation. There is always one patch of the Universe that is inflating, creating more and more pocket universes. And this will continue to happen eternally. I will show this for new inflation, and comment on what happens in chaotic inflation. 2) Measure Problem: In an eternally inflating Universe (multiverse?) it is very hard to define probabilities if one wants to make predictions. I will show that probability of having a 13.7 Gyr universe (like ours) is less probable than having a 13 Gyr universe. But more importantly, in proper time cut-off this ratio is exp(-10^60), while in scale factor cut-off it is 0.8! 3) Unlikeliness Problem: This issue was raised by Steinhardt, et al after Planck results came out. They argue that the plateau like potential that are favored by Planck are less likely to produce inflation compared to, say, quadratic potentials. This 'problem' is a subject of debate.
