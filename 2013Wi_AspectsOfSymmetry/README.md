The idea for this quarter is to give talks on Sidney Coleman's textbook, "Aspects of Symmetry." Some good supplementary material can be found in the book "Solitons and Instantons" by R. Rajaraman or the papers recommended by Coleman at the end of each chapter. Also check out Radiative Corrections as the Origin of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and The Magnetic Monopole Fifty Years Later. Students who are not giving talks are encouraged to read along!


Dilatation, 1/11
Speaker - Yu-Sheng Liu
Abstract -
It is known that in very high energy, masses become unimportant. On the other hand, Scale transformation (dilatation) is an exact symmetry if masses vanishes. By studied approximate scale symmetry, hopefully we can learn how scale transformation behave in real world and gain something from where masses are unimportant.
Outline -
1. Noether, Schwinger-Dyson, and Ward
2. scale transformation
3. anomalies
4. Callan-Symanzik
5. return of scale symmetry

Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking I, 1/18
Speaker - Mackenzie Barton-Rowledge
Abstract - This talk covers the basics of spontaneous symmetry breaking of first a real, and then complex scalar field, after which I introduce abelian, and then breifly nonabelian gauge fields and their role in local symmetry preservation and the implications for the Goldstone bosons. Outline:
1. The hill between two mountains
2. Finding Gold at the bottom of a Wine Bottle
3. Local invariance calls for A mew
4. The Fat Cat knows where the Gold is buried
5. Yang Mills fields: A Carnival Game

Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking II, 2/1
Speaker - Seyda Ipek
Abstract - I will start with how to define effective potentials and how to use them to learn more about the theory they effectively represent. As a warm up example, we will calculate 1-loop effective potential for a scalar massless theory. Then we will apply these methods to massless scalar QED, and lo and behold! there is spontaneous symmetry breaking!
Notes - My notes are here. They have many calculation errors, but I am sure I did not do any outrageous physics mistakes. My recommendation for the future speaker would be to use dim-reg and RG flow to present this paper. His way is like super old-fashioned.

Classical Solitons and Monopoles, 2/8
Speaker - John Fuini
Abstract - I will be giving the first talk of a 3-part talk on solitons! I will introduce the existence and properties of classical soliton solutions in classical field theories in 1, 2 and 3 spatial dimensions. I will show how their existence is tied to non-trivial maps from the spatial boundary at infinity to the vacuum manifold. In one case there will be an exact solution. I will then show how magnetic monopoles fit into this discussion.
Notes - Encouraged.

Real phi^4 Solitons in QFT, 2/15
Speaker - Bridget Bertoni
Abstract - I will first briefly review the classical phi^4 soliton (i.e. the kink) that we saw last time. I'll also review what it means to have particles in QFT and how they are connected to classical physics. We'll then quantize the phi^4 kink, discuss the renormalization of the theory, interpret the particles that we find, and see whether or not the soliton can decay.

Solitons and Monopoles III, 2/22
Speaker - Han-Chih Chang
Abstract - The notion of 2D bosonization, Coleman's 1975 work using operator formulation, establishes the quantum equivalence between one interacting 2D fermionic system (massive Thirring model) and another 2D bosonic system (sine-Gordan model). Following Fujikawa's approach of calculating the associated Jacobian of path integral measure from chiral transformation, I will walk through the bosonization of 1) free massless fermion 2) interacting massless fermion (massless Thirring model), and 3) interacting massive fermion model (massive Thirring model).

Instantons I, 3/1
Speaker - Akshay Ghalsasi
Abstract - 1) Instantons in QM 2) Instantons in SU(2) Yang Mills theory.
The first part will demonstrate the use of instantons in QM to calculate non perturbative corrections to the energy levels to the periodic potential problem. It will also serve as an analogy to part 2) where I will demonstrate instantons in SU(2) gauge theory. Most of the discussuion in part 2 will be deriving the classical solution to the instanton. Only at the end I will use quantum mechanics to briefly illustrate the role of the theta parameter.

Instantons II, 3/8
Speaker - Dorota Grabowska
Abstract - First, the U(1) axial problem will be introduced, through a discussion of the symmetries of the QCD Lagrangian and the symmetries seen through experiment. Next, the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly will be derived, using triangle diagrams. Finally, the U(1) axial problem will be resolved by drawing on the work done with instantons in pure SU(2) Yang-Mills and exploring the effect of coupling SU(3) Yang Mills to quarks.

Large N I, 3/15
Speaker - Sudip Paul
Abstract - I introduced large N approximation technique in nonabelian gauge theory. As the number of generators of the gauge group, N, goes to infinity we can develop a perturbation series in 1/N. The leading terms of this expansion often show dramatic simplifications compared to the original theory. I discussed three specific models: phi^4-th theory, Gross-Neveu model and CP^N theory. In large N approximations these theories show dramatic behaviors like dimensional transmutation, asymptotic freedom, spontaneous symmetry breaking, dynamical mass generation etc.

Large N II, 3/22

Abstract - Starting with an overview of the topology and counting in powers of N and using these results to understand general properties of mesons and glueballs in the large N limit. Also presented the 't Hooft model of QCD, including characterizing all vacuum to vacuum diagrams, solving for the corrected propagator and the 't Hooft equation for the spectrum of mesons masses in 1+1 dimensions.
