The aim for this quarter is to better understand the series divergences in QFT. A discussion of series and instantons is given in these lectures by Marino and a good reference for renormalons by Beneke is here. A nice talk by Berry on Stokes phenomena is here.


Asymptotic Series and Stokes Phenomena, 1/10
Speaker - John Fuini
Abstract - I will start by introducing asymptotic series, general properties of a large class of asymptotic series, and how these series are related to integral representations of functions, as well as expanded solutions of differential equations about irregular singular points. I will then show an example of the Stokes phenomenon.

Borel Summation, 1/17
Speaker - Colin LaMont
Abstract - I will go through the derivation of the asymptotic series for the error function from it's integral representation. I then show how running this derivation in reverse leads to a general method for making sense out of all the terms in an asymptotic series, not just the early terms that give us a numerical approximation. We'll go through how this procedure makes good account of Stokes phenomena and non-analytic behavior. We can formalize this procedure using the Laplace and inverse-Laplace (Borel) transforms.

Instantons and Asymptotics in QM, 1/24
Speaker - David Sommer
Abstract - We will explore what instantons can tells us about asymptotic series in quantum mechanics by considering the 1-dimensional anharmonic oscillator. I show that instanton effects characterize the lifetime of an unstable ground state for negative coupling, and in particular, we will approximate the imaginary part of the ground state energy. In parallel, we will find that the analytic structure of the ground state energy E(g) as a function of the coupling will allow us to relate the perturbative expansion of E(g) at positive coupling to our instanton calculation at negative coupling. We will arrive at the startling conclusion that instanton effects control the the large order behavior of our expansion coefficients.

Instantons in Quantum Mechanics I, 1/31
Speaker - Brandon Robinson
Abstract - In this talk, we will study the instanton effects in the 1-D double well potential. We will begin with a brief overview of the state of affairs in the lecture series with a focus on Borel Resummation and its use in discussing instantons. We will then calculate the one-instanton contribution in lifting the two-fold degneracy in the energy spectrum that one would naively calculation in perturbation theory for the double well. The techniques used for the single instanton calculations introduced last week will be generalized to consider instanton-anti-instanton pairs with a short discussion of the ambiguity that arises to follow. Lastly, we will follow the work of Zinn-Justin in generalizing to an arbitrary number of instantons where we will recover the previous results.

Instantons in QFT, 2/7
Speaker - Stefan Janiszewski
Abstract - Today I am going to talk about instantons in QFTs and their effects. We will do so in the context of large N Chern-Simons theory. The reason for this is that being a theory without a running coupling we do not need to concern ourselves with "renormalons." We will find large N instantons that lead to trans-series for the asymptotic expansions of quantities. Stokes phenomena will manifest itself as phase transitions between vacua as the coupling is adjusted.

Renormalon I, 2/14
Speaker - Michael Wagman
Abstract - This talk discusses what goes wrong when we try and make sense of QFT perturbation theory using Borel summation. I'll be focusing on QCD, where ambiguities in perturbative expansions can be associated with instantons or with so-called renormalons. We will see in the instanton case that non-perturbative physics gives rise to ambiguities in the Borel transforms of correlation functions. There are also ambiguities arising in perturbative expansions for these functions that are conjectured to cancel the non-perturbative instanton ambiguities. In the renormalon case we will see ambiguities arising from the ultraviolet and infrared behavior of renormalized loop diagrams and assert that if perturbative expansions are meaningful these ambiguities must be cancelled by other non-perturbative effects. In this way renormalons tell us about the scaling of some non-perturbative corrections to perturbative expansions.

Resurgence in QFT I, 2/28
Speaker - Han-Chih Chang
Abstract - The basic notions of resurgence is introduced following Costin; Focused on extracting the exact energy eigenvalue of the QM doulble-wall potential, the ambiguity-free trans-series representation, the resurgence triangle structure associated with different topological sectors, and the reconstruction of none-perturbative contribution from the perturbative contribution are introduced following Dunne and Unsal.

Resurgence in QFT II, 3/7
Speaker - Seyda Ipek
Abstract - This quarter we saw that renormalizable QFTs have singularities in the Borel plane which render the perturbation theory ambiguous. There is however one model which is unambiguous: CP^(N-1) model. I will give an introduction to this model. I will specifically work with CP^(N-1) model on RxS (where the spatial coordinate is compactified) with twisted boundary conditions. We will see that compactified boundary conditions on a spatially compactified spacetime produces topological defects, kink-instantons, with charge 1/N. An instanton with charge 1 can be decomposed into N kink-instantons with charge 1/N.

Resurgence in QFT III, 3/14
Speaker - Max Hansen
Abstract - I discuss resurgence in field theory, specifically considering CP^{N-1}-valued fields on a 2D cylinder spacetime (R^1 * S^1). This model is asymptotically free and thus has IR-renormal ambiguities which cannot be cancelled by instanton-anti-instanton ambiguities. To understand the issue, Mithat Unsal and Gerald Dunne found a form of compactification which exhibits large N volume independence. This means that the strongly coupled regime is continuously connected to a non-trivial weakly coupled regime where the question of ambiguity cancellation can be addressed.
