# -tons !

This quarter, we'll be talking primarily about -tons: instantons and solitons, to be precise. Primary references are Srednicki's QFT and Coleman's Aspects of Symmetry.

The talk list is as follows:

* Solitons & Monopoles - 1/19 - Sam
* Quantum Lumps & Sine-Gordon - 1/26 - Jesse
* Instanton intro/Summing - 2/2 - Tyler
* Vacuum Structure of Gauge Theories - 2/9 - Peter
* BKT transition - 2/16 - Tyler
* Unstable vacua and tunneling - 2/23 - Dake
* Polyakov model - 3/2 - Kyle
* Finite Temperature YM - 3/9 - Andy
