This quarter we will discuss the QCD phase diagram. A short overview is given here, and a more in depth review is given here. Also check out these conference slides. Previous PTJC references (e.g. from Finite Temperature QFT, Critical Phenomena, Confinement, Color Superconductivity, Thermal Field Theory, and Phases of Gauge Theories) may be useful.


Introduction to Phase Transitions, 9/27
Speaker - Seyda Ipek
Abstract - I will start with a quick and very formal description of phase transitions, and jump into the Ising Model right away. Ising Model does not have a phase transition in 1-dimension at finite temperature, however there is a phase transition in 2-dimensions. Using these phase transitions as examples, we will see how renormalization group works, and how one can map out the whole phase diagram of a system using renormalization group flow.

Restoration of Chiral Symmetry at High Temperature, 10/18
Speaker - Max Hansen
Abstract - I first give a general discussion of spontaneous symmetry breaking, using the examples of a complex scalar field in a wine bottle potential as well as the Gross-Neveu model. I then turn to two-flavor massless QCD, discussing the symmetries and using spontaneously broken chiral symmetry to motivate chiral perturbation theory (ChPT). Finally I introduce the linear sigma model as a simpler alternative with important common features to ChPT. Here I sketch out finite-temperature properties of the theory and highlight certain issues that arise in the finite-temperature expansion.

Lattice Sign Problem at Finite Density and Ways to Get Around It, 11/1
Speaker - Dorota Grabowska
Abstract - Due to the nonperturbative nature of QCD at low energies, lattice methods are employed. Lattice methods use Monte Carlo methods to evaluate the path integrals. These methods are viable at finite temperature; however, at finite chemical potential, the weight that is used for Monte Carlo simulations becomes complex. Therefore, Monte Carlo evaluation cannot be used. This is the so-called Sign Problem. In this talk, I will first introduce Monte Carlo methods and how the Sign Problem arises. Next, I will present several methods to get around the Sign Problem - reweighing, imaginary chemical potential and the grand canonical ensemble - and their regimes of viability.

Intro to Superfluidity and Superconductivity, 11/8
Speaker - Bridget Bertoni
Abstract - At high density and low temperature, QCD transitions into a superconducting phase. In this talk I will give a introduction to superconductivity and the related phenomenon of superfluidity. I'll begin with a quantum mechanics motivation for Cooper pairs following Cooper's calculation done a year before the discovery of BCS theory. I will also introduce a non-relativistic EFT to describe these phases and discuss some important results--the gap equation, the critical temperature, and other predictions of the theory.

Color Superconductivity, 11/15
Speaker - Ermal Rrapaj
Abstract - At extremely high densities and low temperatures, nuclear matter can be effectively described quarks and gluons as asymptotic states. Given the physical conditions mentioned, there can various color superconducting phases of QCD. This talk will mention briefly the main ones covered in literature and focus on the CFL condensate and analyse which symmetries it breaks. Then, the gap equation will be derived in gluon exchange and solved for by using Nambu-Gorkov spinors and working in the CJT formalism. The color Meissner effect will be described and analyzed after the gap and critical temperature are found.

Holographic QGP, 12/13
Speaker - Stefan Janiszewski
Abstract - I will calculate the shear viscosity of a strongly coupled plasma that will stand in as a tractable model for the strongly coupled Quark Gluon Plasma. After reviewing the QGP and its behaviour in experiments, I will introduce the model and the tool used for the non-perturbative calculation. After working through the detailed calculation, I will then discuss how its results have impacted our understanding.
