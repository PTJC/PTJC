# Dualities

This quarter was an exploration into various instances of dualities. We did not keep a thorough record this quarter, for unknown reasons (whoops). 

My recollection is that we did a few talks on AdS/CFT, followed by some other examples of dualities. If anyone still has their talks, please post it!

Last talk of the quarter was given by John Lombard, showing the spinfoam/lattice Yang-Mills strong-weak duality.
