<dl><dt>General SUSY references
</dt></dl>
<p>There are a large number of references on SUSY. Below are a representative sampling with commentary to help you pick the one (or ones) that work for you:
</p>
<ul><li>Aitchison's <i>Supersymmetry and the MSSM: An Elementary Introduction</i> hep-ph/0505105  has a gentle discussion (something like Zee's book in level, though less witty) with low pre-reqs. This was also published as a book, which presumably has less typos. It will not get you the detail you desire, but makes good bedtime reading so that more-detailed accounts go down smoothly.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><i>A Supersymmetry Primer</i> by Stephan Martin hep-ph/9709356 is more in-depth, with a phenomenological bent.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Ed Witten's Erice lectures are available in limited supply outside of Steve's office. Please only take one if you are ready to read it. The tone is conversational and typically Witten-insightful.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Steve Weinberg's Vol 3 will keep you covered for the entire quarter. His notation can at times be a bit baroque. Some professors meet statements like "I was thinking of reading Weinberg's book" with the question "Why on Earth would you want to do that?" What I've read of it was nice though.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Finally, there is Wess and Bagger. Everyone says the same thing about Wess and Bagger: "Everything in the book is correct." If you're not certain, yes that is the physics book equivalent of telling someone you set them up with a blind date who "has a great personality." It is true, though, that when indices are raised and lowered and dotted and undotted you want a reference you can trust, and that reference is <i>Supersymmetry and Supergravity</i> by Wess and Bagger.
</li></ul>
<dl><dt>4/2 - Why supersymmetry?
</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Alan Jamison
</li>
<li>Abstract - We are accustomed to theories where internal and spacetime symmetries are strictly separated. Is this necessary? If one is sufficiently clever (cruel?) theories where the two are mixed together can be written down. However, Coleman and Mandula showed that for some reasonable assumptions (and one not as reasonable) this partitioning of spacetime and internal symmetries is exact. We will see some vague, physical arguments for this. From there we will talk about how graded symmetries can evade this no-go theorem and why we think such symmetries are just super! Finally, we will meet the full Coleman-Mandula argument head-on, filling in as many details as time allows.

<dl><dt>4/30 - The Geometry of Superspace Gauge Theories

<ul><li>Stefan Janiszewski

<li>Abstract -  I will formally develop the notion of superspace, as well as superfields living on it. We will then consider general gauge
</li></ul>
<p>theories of these fields, and apply constraints which lead to the known minimal theory. A familiarity with superspace will be useful, as that part will go quickly. Throughout the geometric viewpoint will be stressed.
