# PTJC
Database for the UW Particle Theory Journal Club

This org/repo is designed to replace the former PTJC [website](https://sharepoint.washington.edu/phys/wiki/ptjc/). Due to administrative issues in managing the old site, we have migrated our efforts to this open forum. Previous topics and notes can be found on the original site. Future notes, as they are provided, will be able to be found in this repository within the appropriate folder. 

## About

The PTJC is a graduate-student-run weekly seminar series designed to expose new techniques and concepts to students involved in the field which they would have otherwise not encountered in their own research or coursework, or to probe in depth releated material. Each quarter, approximately 8-10 talks are delivered on Fridays from 2:30-3:30 in C421. Practice talks are given on Wednesdays at 4:00 in B405 to the peer group for the opportunity for guidence, suggestions, and enriched questioning before the official talk. We highly encourage students interested in particle, nuclear, or gravitational theory to join us, even if only for the practice talks, and of course welcome anyone who would like to participate. 

In order to balance the need for topics which serve as theoretical backbones and those which push the envelope of our understanding, we have decided (2018) on a new structure structure moving forward. 
* The autumn quarter will be reserved for pedagogical reviews following well sourced books or lecture material that everyone should know, but may not encounter all at once. For past examples, classical solutions (instantons/solitons), or lattice gauge theory would fit. This is to allow for a gentle introduction for new students giving their first talks. 
* The winter will be reserved for slightly more ambitious topics, wherein we can introduce a methodology or theoretical technique, and then explore various applications of this subject depending on individual interests. For past examples, matrix models or anomalies would fit.
* The spring will be reserved for subjects that ideally folks are interested in learning something about, but no one already has an expertise in. The spring allows us to use our accumulated experience throughout the year to tackle more difficult topics. This includes recent reviews on cutting edge research or currently burgeoning areas of physics for which there may not yet be faculty involvement here at UW. Past examples would be our quarter on the geometric amplitudes program, or resurgence. 
The goal of this change is to provide more 'flow' in the topic selections for a given year, and to alieviate the tension between when to select topics that everyone should know as a comprehensive review, and when to try something completely foreign as a survey glance. 

## Course Credit

The PTJC officially corresponds to PHYS-582. Signing up for 1 credit requires attendence of the talks, while 2 credits requires delivering a talk.

## Contributions/How to

To contribute your notes, no knowledge of git is required: simply make a github account and request to be added to the list of collaborators for this repo. You can then upload your notes in PDF or .tex form by going into the talk directory, clicking on 'Upload Files', and adding your content. Informative file names would be appreciated.

Each quarter's directories will have an associated README with general topic information and links to references which will be used throughout the quarter. Feel free to edit this file and include any additional references you may have used for your talk.

## Future-proofing
Org owners with member management privileges will promote the new PTJC head as an owner, maintaining administrative control for posterity.
