# PTJC
Database for the UW Particle Theory Journal Club

This repo is designed to replace the former PTJC [website](https://sharepoint.washington.edu/phys/wiki/ptjc/). Due to administrative issues in managing the old site, we have migrated out efforts to this open forum. 

The PTJC is a graduate student run weekly seminar series designed to expose new techniques and concepts to students involved in the field which they would have otherwise not encountered in their own research or coursework, or to probe in depth releated material. Each quarter, approximately 8-10 talks are delivered on Fridays from 2:30-3:30 in C420. Practice talks are given on Wednesdays at 4:00 in B421 to the peer group for the opportunity for guidence, suggestions, and enriched questioning before the official talk. We highly encourage students interested in particle, nuclear, or gravitational theory to join us, even if only for the practice talks. 

The PTJC officially corresponds to PHYS-582. Signing up for 1 credit requires attendence of the talks, while 2 credits requires delivering a talk.

Former topics and notes can be found on the old PTJC site. Future notes, as they are provided, will be able to be found in this repository within the appropriate folder. 

To contribute your notes, no knowledge of git is required: simply make a github account and request to be added to the list of collaborators for this repo. You can then upload your notes in PDF or .tex form. 

Each quarter's directories will have an associated README with general topic information and links to references which will be used throughout the quarter. Feel free to edit this file and include any additional references you may have used for your talk.

Management of this repo will be continually transfered to the sitting PTJC head for posterity.
