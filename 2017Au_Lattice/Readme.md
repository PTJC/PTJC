# Lattice Field Theory

This quarter, we are giving an introduction to the lattice and associated topics.

Our primary reference will be notes from [Steve's class](http://faculty.washington.edu/srsharpe/578/daily.html), as well as 

"Lattice Gauge Theories: An Introduction," (World Scientific Lecture Notes in Physics, Vol. 82; 4th Ed. 2012) by Heinz J. Rothe.

"Quantum Fields on a Lattice," (Cambridge Monographs on Mathematical Physics, 1997) by Istvan Montvay and Gernot Munster.

and Steve's [INT Summer School Notes](http://faculty.washington.edu/srsharpe/578/intpp.pdf). 

The tentative talk list will be as follows:

* 10/6: QM on the lattice, Dake
* 10/13: Intro to path int/scalars and reflection positivity, Sam
* 10/20: Gauge theory and the haar measure, Tyler
* 10/27: Fermion problems, Natalie
* 11/3: Fermion solutions, Andrew
* 11/17: Problems with fermion solutions/the sign problem, Isaac
* 12/1: QCD and numerical results, Peter
* 12/8: Instantons, Jesse
* 12/15: Open bonus week

The last two talks may be flipped in their weeks. Also Natalie/Andrew may flip their positions.

We may also reconsider combining the first 2 fermion talks into one if there is a nice way to do that without being overwhelming, which gives Andrew the opportunity to give a bonus talk on gravity on the lattice.
