# Scattering Amplitudes

This quarter, we are investigating the spinor-helicity formalism 
and modern on-shell methods for calculating scattering amplitudes.

Our primary reference will be "Scattering Amplitudes in Gauge Theory and
Gravity" by Henriette Elvang and Yu-Tin Huang, a preprint of which can be 
found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1697).

Mike also suggested the following video lectures from [TASI](https://physicslearning.colorado.edu/tasi/tasi_2016/tasi_2016.html)

The tentative talk list will be as follows:

* 1/13: Introduction to Spinor Helicity and General Motivation, Peter
* 1/20: BCFW Recursion Relations, Jesse
* 1/27: Further BCFW, Natalie
* 2/3: N=4 SYM, Andrew
* 2/10: Loops Part 1--Generalized Unitarity, Kyle
* 2/17: Loops Part 2--Loop BCFW, Issac
* 2/24: Loops Part 3--Singularity Structures, Mason
* 3/3: Grassmania and Amplituhedra, John
* 3/10: Supergravity Amplitudes, Mike
* 3/17: Color Dualities, Brandon
