Special edition: Research topics


The idea here is for PTJC members to give a talk about their own research, which could be about anything between specific results to a broad overview of a given field of interest. The idea is to have a special PTJC edition on research topics every 1-2 years in order to promote collaboration among students, and also to encourage new students to start giving PTJC talks.
