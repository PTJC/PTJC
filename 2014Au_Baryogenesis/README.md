Intro to Baryogenesis, 10/10
Speaker - Akshay Ghalsasi
Abstract - I will beginning by explaining why baryogenesis is a problem. I will go on to explain the Sakharov conditions. In the final part I will be giving some examples of baryogenesis that illustrate how the Sakharov conditions are used.

Baryon Number Violation, 10/17
Speaker - Mike Campbell
Abstract - I give a brief introduction to EW baryogenisis, after which I will show that although B number violation is a classical symmatry of the lagrangian, B number violation is possible withen the standard model.

Sphalerons - About to Fall, 10/24
Speaker - Mackenzie Barton-Rowledge
Abstract - I will continue where Mike left off with baryon number violation, working through the gauge structure of the sphaleron and its topological features. Then I will address the rate of baryon number production for three interesting temperatures: T=0, T<T(critical), and T>T(critical), showing that baryon number is not significantly violated during any of these regimes. This leaves T=T(critical) and its accompanying non-equilibrium conditions (if the phase transition is first order!) as the only place where baryogenesis may occur.

First Order Phase Transition, 10/31
Speaker - Derek Horkel
Abstract - In the final talk on electroweak baryogenesis, I will begin by recapping the Sakharov conditions before discussing CP violation in the standard model. After this, I will sketch how baryogenesis occurs via bubbles and then describing the first-order transition in the Higgs potential which allows these bubbles to form.

BSM Baryogenesis, 11/14
Speaker - Dorota Grabowska
Abstract - For the first 'Beyond the Standard Model' baryogenesis talk, I will be discussing Grand Unified Theories (GUT), focusing mostly on minimal SU(5). I will begin by discussing the motivations for looking at GUTs, followed by the method of embedding the Standard Model gauge groups into SU(5). As a first check, we will calculate the weak angle. With the SM fermionic matter fields placed into 5* and 10 representations, we find baryon number violating vertices. Lastly, we calculate the amount of baryon number generated in minimal SU(5). The amount is insufficient, due to the need to go to three loop order and also due to the fact that SU(5) does not violate B-L; recall that electroweak sphalerons wipe out any B+L generated above the electroweak scale. However, other GUT gauge groups do violate B+L and thus can produce sufficient baryon number, while remaining within phenomenological bounds.

Leptogenesis, 12/05
Speaker - Mike Wagman
Abstract -
Leptogenesis is a model of baryogenesis involving heavy right-handed neutrinos along with the standard model. Lepton number violating decays of these heavy neutrinos lead to a net B-L asymmetry in the early universe that can be converted to B asymmetry through electroweak sphaleron processes. I'll be discussing how this model can successfully reproduce observed baryon asymmetries but has limited predictive power due to the large number of neutrino masses and couplings that are generically present in the model.
