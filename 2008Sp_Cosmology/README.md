<dl><dt>4/11 - Introduction to Cosmology
</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Jon Walsh
</li>
<li>Abstract - After a summary of GR, we derive the Robertson-Walker metric and Friedmann equations based on simple observations about our universe.  We then discuss what could make up our universe, and introduce the basic parameters of cosmology.  After a summary of experimental results, we discuss the evolution of our universe and the problems we face in understanding it.

<li>Abstract - Cosmic inflation.

<dl><dt>4/25 - Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Chris Vermilion
</li>
<li>Abstract - I will be discussing Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, i.e., Why is there Something instead of Something Else?
</li>
<li>Refs - Carroll and Trodden have a short section on this.  The review by Tytler, et al. (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0001318" class="external text" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0001318" rel="nofollow">astro-ph/0001318</a>) doesn't have much on the physics of BBN as opposed to measurement of nuclear abundances.  I will be working mostly from Barbara Ryden's cosmology textbook, a copy of which is on reserve in the library.

<dl><dt>5/2 - Cosmic Microwave Background
</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Steve Paik
</li>
<li>Abstract - My goal is to explain where it comes from and what its properties are. The discussion will assume very little prior knowledge of the CMB; instead I will start where nucleosynthesis leaves off. Precise measurement of the CMB has many implications for both cosmology and particle physics, however I will only be able to touch on the consequences briefly.

<dl><dt>5/9 - Dark matter and the formation of large scale structure in the universe
</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Rob Schabinger
</li>
<li>Abstract -  Dark matter and the formation of large scale structure in the universe. The CMB gives us a map of the primordial fluctuations of the energy density of the universe. In the last twenty-five years, a great deal of progress has been made in understanding the large scale structure of the universe by starting from the initial conditions given by the CMB and simulating the evolution of the universe forward in time to the present epoch. It turns out that dark matter plays a dominant role in the formation of this large scale structure. The talk will first review the evidence for and experimental constraints on dark matter. Then the formation of structure in the universe will be discussed in detail. Finally, I will present a couple of the more commonly discussed particle physics scenarios which could naturally explain the presence of dark matter in the universe.

<dl><dt>5/23 - Baryogenesis I
</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Kristan Jensen
</li>
<li>Abstract - We will investigate the basics of baryogenesis. We will briefly review the history of the subject and the basic conditions for any theory that gives rise to a baryon (lepton) asymmetry. In particular, baryon number symmetry must be broken. We will briefly examine a GUT theory where baryon number is violated at the perturbative level to see how to predict the baryon asymmetry from a given model; we will then transition to talk about baryon asymmetry in the standard model. This discussion will naturally lead us to a review of instantons, anomalies, and the importance of electroweak symmetry breaking.

</li>
<li>Abstract - I plan to review the basic questions/features of baryogenesis, and then discuss several possible solutions other than the GUT solutions covered by Kristan last week.

<dl><dt>6/9 - Gravitational waves
</dt></dl>
<ul><li>Gary Howell
</li>
<li>Abstract - I will start with an overview of gravitational waves, including production and energy considerations.  I will then discuss 2 examples of interest to cosmology:  gravitational waves during 1st-order phase transitions in the early universe (vaccuum bubble collisions), and gravitational waves as a "standard candle" to determine absolute distances.
