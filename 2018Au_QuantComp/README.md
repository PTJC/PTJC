# Quantum Computing/Information

The talk list is as follows:

* **10/5: Introduction (Sam) -- (Mike & Ike Ch 1)**

  Advertisements (e.g., Shor’s alg, Grover’s alg, Feynman’s proposal, quantum cryptography)
  
  Qubits (e.g., computational basis, Bloch sphere, single qubit information)
  
  Multiple qubits, Bell states, two-bit entanglement
  
  If time: Bell’s inequalities
  
  No-cloning theorem, CNOT, teleportation
  
  Deutch’s alg, Deutsch-Jozsa alg
  
* **10/12: Quantum circuit model (Huangyu) -- (Mike & Ike Ch 4 and ?)**
