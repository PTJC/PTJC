This quarter we will discuss Effective Field Theories (EFTs). During the first three weeks we will cover the Operator Product Expansion (OPE). The next three weeks will be on Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) and the final three weeks will be on Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET).


Introduction to OPEs, 4/5
Speaker - Stefan Janiszewski
Abstract - The quarter kicks off with an introduction to the operator product expansion. After discussing the notion and its validity, we will explore the consequences of symmetries, and the complications introduced from renormalization in interacting theories.

Applications of OPE to Deep Inelastic Scattering, 4/12
Speaker - Han-Chih Chang
Abstract - Continued from last talk, I will examine the application of OPE in the framework of lower energy effective theory: Using weak meson decay as a motivation, the notions of operation renormalization, operation mixing, and operator coefficient running are revisited, ending with the perturbative approximation for delta-Isospin-equal-one-half rule for Kaon decay.

Applications of OPE to Conformal Field Theory, 4/19
Speaker - Sudip Paul
Abstract - I talked about applications of OPEs to CFT. Among other things I covered Virasoro algebra, central charge and the Weyl anomaly. Towards the end of the talk there was also a discussion about state-operator equivalence.

Introduction to HQET, 4/26
Speaker - Yu-Sheng Liu
Abstract - The concept of HQET is not exactly the same as usual EFT. I start from the observation of mass spectrum of heavy mesons. There must be some symmetry to protect the mass splitting. Next, I motivate the physical argument of HQ approximation, then write down its Lagrangian in both position and momentum space in different approach. To relate to physical quantities, matrix element is necessary. I show how to calculate matrix element under HQ approximation. Finally, I discuss the difference between EFT and HQET.

Chiral Pertubation Theory, 5/3
Speaker - Derek Horkel
Abstract - Introduction to chiral perturbation theory as it applies to light mesons. I start by introducting chiral symmetry breaking and working out the chiral Lagrangian. Then I show how this gives lowest order results for light pion mass ratios and will motivate the power counting at higher orders. Lastly, the low energy coefficients (LECs) were be discussed.
Outline -
1. Energy Scales
2. Chiral Symmetry Breaking
3. Chiral Lagrangian
4. LO Meson Masses
5. Power counting
6. Low Energy Coefficents

Heavy Meson Chiral Perturbation Theory, 5/10
Speaker - Akshay Ghalsasi
Abstract - I will begin by talking briefly about the motivations for constructing such a theory.
Next I will motivate how the heavy meson field should look like and the Lorentz properties it should possess

Then we will construct a heavy meson chiral Lagrangian at lowest order and discuss the corrections that come from breaking the heavy quark spin symmetry at a higher order.

we will discuss the corrections to heavy meson decay constants coming from HMXPT.

SCET II, 5/24
Speaker - Dorota Grabowska
Abstract - I will begin with a short review of SCET, introducing some more technology and notation that we will use. I will then move on to discuss gauge invariance, which will determine the form of operators in SCET. Next, I will give a general overview of the process of calculating the cross section using SCET. Lastly, I will work through how the dijet current factorizes into components that depend on different energy scales.
