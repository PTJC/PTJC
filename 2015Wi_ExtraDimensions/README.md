Kaluza Klein I, 1/9
Speaker - Tyson Price
Abstract - In this talk the Kaluza Klein ansatz was motivated and introduced. Then 5-D geodesic trajectories were shown to recover the covariant 4-D form for charged particles in an electromagnetic field. The 5-D Einstein Hilbert action was shown to reduce to the 4-D Electro-Vacuum action. Finally the dynamics of a scalar field was shown to separate into towers of different mass and charged particles each recovering the form of a u(1) gauge theory. Inconsistencies in naive dimensional reduction were briefly discussed.

Kaluza Klein II, 1/16
Speaker - Brandon Robinson
Abstract - In this talk, we will explore the semi-classical instabilities of the Kaluza-Klein vacuum. The bounce configuration will be found to interpolate between a flat spacetime with one compact, periodically identified direction and one in which there is an expanding `bubble of nothing'. The bubble will expand to hit null infinity at which point we no longer have a metric description of our manifold. We will study how to stabilize the vacuum with the addition of fermions. Lastly, we will cover some cursory statements about up-tunneling (anti-instanton) events and bubbles in AdS.

Randall Sundrum II, 2/13
Speaker - Mike Wagman
Abstract - I describe Randall and Sundrum's model that reproduces 4D gravity while including a non-compact extra dimension and then discuss interesting holographic interpretations of compact and non-compact RS models in an AdS/CFT context.
