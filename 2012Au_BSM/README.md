Autumn 2012: Beyond the Standard Model

Introduction, 10/5
Speaker - Seyda Ipek
Abstract - Interactions of elementary particles are explained pretty well by the Standard Model (SM) and electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) via Higgs mechanism. This introduction covers a brief history of particle physics, SM lagrangian and summary of particle interactions, EWSB, and the shortcomings of the SM.

SUSY Algebra and Wess-Zumino Model, 10/12
Speaker - John Fuini
Abstract - I began by motivating supersymmetry following Aitchison. I discussed the Coleman-Mandula theorem and showed heuristically how the argument goes. From the schematic form of a graded lie algebra I derived the SUSY algebra (actual derivation was done for the practice talk, and just summarized for the final talk). I then derived the massive and massless representations for a general number of Q species. Finally I applied a brute force style of finding a super symmetric lagrangian for the chiral supermultiplet including interactions - and this ended up being the Wess-Zumino model. Everything was done in component formalism (No superfields).

Superspace, Superfields, and Intro to the MSSM, 10/19
Speaker - Bridget Bertoni
Abstract - I will first motivate and introduce superspace and superfields. I will then go over chiral superfields in some detail and confirm the Wess-Zumino field transformations seen last time using component field formalism. Finally, I will construct the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (the MSSM) using superfields, and talk briefly about the beyond the Standard Model aspects of the MSSM.

SUSY Breaking, 10/26
Speaker - Han-Chih Chang
Abstract - I will first present the non-renormalization theorem of superpotential following Seiberg's symmetry argument, which renders SUSY breaking either explicitly at tree level, spontaneously, or dynamically (nonperturbatively). I will then review notions of spurion superfields and "soft" explicitly tree-level SUSY breaking for the hierarchy problem, and then introduce spontaneous SUSY breaking, including F-type and D-type breaking, goldstino vs. gravitino from SUGRA, and the mass-supertrace constrain. Finally, the messenger paradigm is introduced, supplemented with the gauge and anomaly mediated SUSY breaking mechanisms.

Dark Matter 11/2
Speaker - Dorota Grabowska
Abstract - I will start off discussing the U(1) axial and Strong CP problem. I will then move to talking about axions, including their dynamics, their behavior in the early Universe and also their candidacy as Dark Matter. I will then wrap up with some experimental evidence for why we should even be looking for axions and Dark Matter itself.

Neutrinos, 11/9
Speaker - Mackenzie Barton-Rowledge
Abstract - I reviewed a few key points of the history of neutrinos, pausing to look in depth at the solar neutrino problem and the atmospheric neutrino problem. Then I covered standard neutrino oscillations in vacuum, a constant matter field, and in the adiabatic limit (a model for the sun). Finally, I introduced the (shaky) evidence for sterile neutrinos and the implications thereof.

Higgs I - Multi-Higgs Model, 11/16
Speaker - Yu-Sheng Liu
Abstract - For the first part of this talk, as an easiest example of multi-Higgs Model, I introduced two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), which included the general form of the Lagrangian in scalar sector, unitary gauge, Yukawa coupling, the structure of Flavor Changing Neutral Current (FCNC), and CP Violation. For the second part of it, I introduced some applications of multi-Higgs model to dark matter, neutrino mass, and Unifying Coupling Constants.
