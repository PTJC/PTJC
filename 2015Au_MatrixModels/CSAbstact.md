Over the past lectures, we have seen matrix models give us topological information about a variety of gauge theories.  In this talk, we will explore the connection between an honest, topological field theory (pure Chern-Simons in d=3) and an odd matrix model with a lograithmic potential for the eigenvalues (Stieltjes-Wigert).  First, we will discuss the SW model and find its eigenvalue distribution.  We will then talk about the non-perturbative calculation of the partition function of CS on a three-sphere by performing surgery on manifolds.  In the end, we will find a description of the CS partition function that can be shown to be exactly that of the SW matrix model.
