Matrix elements of quark fields in QCD and related theories can be
described as functions of a random matrix, the Dirac operator,
averaged over a particular probability distribution encoding the
dynamics of quarks and gluons. Universality of matrix models suggests
there may be some properties of these matrix elements that do not
depend on the particular form of this probability distribution. In
1992, Shuryak and Verbaarschot validated this suggestion and showed
that the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking observed in QCD is a
generic feature of matrix models with chiral symmetry. In this talk I
review their result and discuss a few of its implications.
