We would like to understand deconfinemnt in Yang-Mills Theories, whcih are believed to be confining for small N, however this is still unproven in general.  This is not possible to do analytically; however, if we take the large N limit, we arrive at  a theory which is analyttically tractable, and is believed to share many common features with finite N gauge theories.  This talk will specifically focus on Large N gauge thoeries which are weakly coupled on a compact manifold.  I will then show that this theory can be simplified into a matrix model, which can then be shown to have a deconfinement phase transition.
